As Alaska only has an at-large congressional district, there is no discussion to be made regarding redistricting in the Last Frontier. However, I still have created a helpful (and hopefully aesthetically pleasing) infographic showing the results of the 2020 Presidential election, mapped by census block group.  Unfortunately, there were a few minor rendering issues that I was unable to resolve, but the map remains informative.
