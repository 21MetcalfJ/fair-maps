The history of redistricting in Arkansas is a reflection of the utter demise suffered by the AR Democratic party. Formerly one of the bluest states in the country and home of favorite son Bill Clinton, the Democratic party was the dominant force the Natural State’s politics for much of the 1990s and 2000s. In recent years, however, the state has become one of the most solidly Republican regions in the country. There are several explanations for the demise of the Arkansas Democrats; however, the simplest explanation is that Arkansas’ demographics are simply incompatible with the modern Democratic coalition. As each party became more ideologically polarized, the coalition that was largely composed of rural conservative Democrats began to unravel. Though they fully controlled the 2010 redistricting process in the state and in fact tried to gerrymander the map to maintain their edge, the attempt fully backfired. Over the course of President Obama’s tenure, control of Arkansas’ state government, senate seats, and congressional delegation fell firmly into Republican hands. Today, the future of the AR Dems seems grim.  

There are generally two conflicting redistricting philosophies in Arkansas. One strategy, which favors factors such as compactness and urban communities of interest, would place the entirety of the Little Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area in one district to create a competitive, though red-leaning, district. This philosophy is reflected in the current Arkansas congressional map. However, to ensure that the district will stay uncompetitive throughout the decade, the Republican-controlled legislature approved a map that splits the Black population of Little Rock into three separate districts—diluting their voting power and ensuring the seat stays in Republican hands. Chicanery aside, there is a valid argument to be made for this configuration; metropolitan areas generally constitute a valid community of interest, and the districts yielded by this arrangement would be quite compact. However, I believe that one should prioritize both partisan fairness as well as minority representation over keeping together metro areas. Moreover, I find the rationale justifying the alternative configuration of the district (which will be discussed shortly) to be much more compelling than the reasoning for the former.

The other philosophy, which the map above follows, would also create a district anchored by the city of Little Rock. However, instead of taking it the conservative exurban areas surrounding it, the district would snake eastward, taking in the city of Pine Bluff along with the counties comprising the Arkansas delta along the Mississippi River. Doing so would create a Democratic-leaning district in which Black voters comprise approximately 39% of the population, making it likely the seat would elect a person of color. This district unfortunately would not be mandated by the Voting Rights Act in its current state, as it would be neither majority-Black nor guaranteed to elect the representative of choice of Black voters. However, any cartographer paying careful attention to minority communities and representation would likely draw a district similar to the one displayed.

**Arkansas’ 1st Congressional District**
*District Rating: Lean Democratic*
As has been discussed previously, Arkansas’ first congressional district in this hypothetical configuration is the only democratically-leaning seat that can feasibly be drawn in a state as lopsidedly Republican as Arkansas. The seat is anchored by the state capital, Little Rock, as well as the city of Pine Bluff and another wide swath of poor, mostly black voters in the Arkansas delta. This collection of primarily agricultural counties along the floodplain of the Mississippi River is by far the poorest region of the state. Owing to its immense arability, the region has a deep-rooted history of plantation slavery; it has been referred to as the “deepest of the Deep South”. As mechanized agriculture began to take hold, the need for manual labor disappeared and the mostly-Black population of the delta began to emigrate elsewhere. Today, the region is littered with deserted towns and dying communities (Interestingly, the region is also one of the nation’s largest producers of rice.) Demographically speaking, minority voters comprise about 49% of the district by population, just short of the 50% benchmark to legally necessitate a majority-minority district established by the Thornburg v. Gingles decision. The district is drifting to the right, however, largely because of population decline in the Arkansas delta as well as slight backsliding with minority voters from the Democratic party. This is buffered somewhat by positive trends for Democrats in the affluent Little Rock suburbs in Pulaski County, dampening its rightward shift considerably. Though it will remain Democratic-leaning for the foreseeable future, it could certainly become competitive many years down the line.

**Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District**
*District Rating: Safe Republican*
This rendition of AR-2 keeps the swampy marshes of the (rest of the) Arkansas Delta together before ascending into the eastern foothills of the Ozark plateau. This district is anchored by the small cities of Jonesboro, Conway, and Searcy. Though the district is today safely Republican, it, like the rest of rural Arkansas, has a long Democratic history. Today, though, with its very low degree of urbanization, diversity, and education, this district is demographically hostile to the current Democratic coalition on every level. The district is not growing particularly fast, and there is no reason to suspect that it will become competitive in the future, as leftward trends in some of the district’s largest cities such as Jonesboro and Conway are entirely canceled out by the rightward drift of the seat’s more rural areas.

**Arkansas’ 3rd Congressional District**
*District Rating: Safe Republican*
Arkansas’ 3rd district is notably differentiable from the rest of the state’s political geography. Unlike the rest of the Natural State, Northwestern Arkansas has been ancestrally Republican for decades. Lying in the heart of the Ozarks, the district is anchored by the Fayetteville-Bentonville metro area. For many years, the area acted as a magnet to wealthy suburbanites following the allure of cheap real estate and stable white-collar jobs. This region is the fastest-growing in the state (outpacing Little Rock considerably) and the 13th fastest-growing in the country. Several major Arkansas-based corporations such as Walmart and Tyson Foods have their headquarters in the metro. Like the rest of the state, though, AR-3 has seen significant political realignment in recent years. Accompanying the rapid urban growth in the area, the district has seen a sharp turn towards the left in recent years as educated suburbanites continue to gravitate leftwards. As the map illustrates, however, the region still leans heavily towards the Republican party. Though the district will almost certainly continue to move leftwards, it’s highly unlikely this district will become competitive in the future due to its steep hill of partisanship.

**Arkansas’ 4th Congressional District**
*District Rating: Safe Republican*
Finally, we come to Arkansas’ 4th, nestled in the southern Timberlands region of the state. Birthplace of former president Bill Clinton and held by Democrat Mike Ross until 2013, this district was the last bastion of support for federally-elected Democrats in Arkansas. Like the state’s other predominantly rural districts, the seat is today comfortably Republican, voting for Donald Trump by over 40 points in the 2020 election.
