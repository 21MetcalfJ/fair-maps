![Infographic of my proposed redistricting plan in the state of Arizona.](/Arizona/ArizonaProposedMap.png)
There is far more than meets the eye when discussing redistricting in Arizona. it is one of few states that relegates the drawing of the maps to an independent commission; in fact, it was one of the first states to voluntarily relinquish control of the redistricting pen, doing so over two decades ago. Unfortunately, however, the redistricting process in Arizona remains riddled with contention and sneaky political maneuvering. As it turns out, this devolution of political power has arguably created new problems along with the ones it was intended to solve. Though the implementation of the commission has, by and large, produced maps that seem fair on paper, the process by which the AIRC operates has raised many eyebrows over the years. The 5-person commission comprises 2 Democrats, 2 Republicans, and 1 independent. After party leaders select the partisan members of the commission, these new commissioners then select an independent to be the group’s chair from a preapproved list made by the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments (CACA). Following the formation of the commission, the bureaucracy begins and maps are eventually finalized several months later.

Though this process may seem relatively benign, the process still regularly incites intense criticism from both parties. Even from a cursory glance, it is evident that this system delegates the vast majority of redistricting power to the independent chair of the commission. As the virtually guaranteed tiebreaking vote, their decisions, more than anyone else’s, shape how the state’s congressional and legislative maps will look for the next decade In the years leading up to the 2020 redistricting cycle, the Republican former governor of the state, Doug Ducey, drew backlash over his nominations to the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments, with Democrats arguing that his picks were far too conservative and not diverse enough to reflect Arizona’s population. When it came time to select the members of the AIRC for the round of redistricting following the 2020 census, [nearly all of the names](https://www.salon.com/2021/01/14/arizona-republicans-make-sneaky-moves-to-rig-redistricting-commission-before-any-lines-are-drawn/) produced by the CACA had previously displayed “strong public opinions, or close ties and/or financial interests through jobs, family and partners into the state's [Republican] political power structure”. Eventually, the AIRC selected Chandler resident Erika Neuberg, a psychologist and registered independent who had made several donations to both Democratic and Republican candidates in the past.

Though Neuberg herself may have seemed an unremarkable chairwoman, several of the decisions she made drew harsh critiques from Democratic lawmakers. The political chicanery of the AZGOP was reflected in the mapmaking process several months later through a multitude of insignificant decisions made piecemeal throughout the redistricting process. When commissioners were faced with a controversial decision, Neuberg would [much more often than not](https://azmirror.com/2021/12/10/redistricting-panel-takes-steps-to-bolster-gop-chances-in-latest-changes/) side with her Republican colleagues. The result? A congressional map that, while arguably fair from a legal and partisan standpoint, ultimately lends a not insignificant bias to the Republican party. As these decisions are in many cases district-specific, they will be addressed in my justifications for the drawing of each district as described below. In the Phoenix area, the largest factors I paid attention to were communities of interest, and to a lesser extent municipal boundaries. Furthermore, because the map created by the IRC is *mostly* fair, I will be describing my district configuration in the context of how it differs from the currently implemented map.

**Arizona’s 1st Congressional District**
**District Rating: Tossup**
Arizona’s 1st Congressional District acts as a useful window into Arizonian politics as a whole. Encompassing some of the Phoenix area’s most educated and affluent suburbs, this district lies at the epicenter of the Grand Canyon State’s leftward shift. This has been driven by a combination of different factors working in tandem; suburban realignment and educational polarization combined with explosive growth and rapid diversification have moved the once solidly Republican seat into the competitive column. Though former President Trump won the district by nearly 6 points in the 2016 election, President Biden was able to edge him out 4 years later, carrying the district by a narrow margin of less than 500 votes. Indeed, the northeastern Phoenix suburbs have become increasingly unfriendly towards Republican candidates in recent years. Entirely based in northeastern Maricopa County, the district is anchored by the wealthy municipalities of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley as well as portions of northern Phoenix. Beyond keeping together these economically and demographically aligned communities, this configuration of the 1st also acts as a microcosm of the state as a whole, reflecting its highly suburbanized population and high degree of competitiveness. As the state continues to trend to the left, I expect this district to do the same.

**Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District
District Rating: Tossup**
The second district has been the topic of significant contention. From the layperson’s glance, the districts strange elongated shape and odd-looking tendrils may raise concerns about potential gerrymandering. Moreover, the district coils all the way from the Grand Canyon in northeastern Arizona to metropolitan Phoenix. This seemingly unorthodox arrangement, however, is done for a specific reason; drawing a district in this configuration allows one to incorporate many of Arizona’s federally recognized American Indian reservations into a single district. These tribes include the Kaibab Paiute and Hualapai tribes in Mohave County, the approximately 100,000 members of the Navajo and Hopi nations in the northeastern corner of the state, the Fort Apache tribe in center-east Arizona, and finally, the Gila River reservation south of Phoenix. When combined into a single district, they make up approximately 24% of its total population—a significant portion of the electorate.

Though the Voting Rights Act does not mandate that such a district be drawn, it had in the past been specially created with tribal input to pass preclearance from the DOJ (this was, of course, prior to the Shelby County v. Holder decision). The Native voting bloc, combined with White liberals around Flagstaff and Latino voters in Pinal County, created a competitive district that would [empower these groups](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/native-americans-arizona-redistricting-congressional-map) to elect the candidate of their choice. In the 2020 round of redistricting, however, the AIRC altered this district by adding to it the entirety of Yavapai County, a predominantly rural and ferociously conservative area. In doing so, the district became virtually guaranteed to elect a Republican candidate. In 2022, the Democratic incumbent Tom O’Halleran lost the district handily despite a controversial opponent and strong Democratic performances at the top of the ticket.

It is clear, then, that the inclusion of Yavapai County in the 2nd district arguably dilutes representation for Native voters. Moreover, the county’s predominantly rural White population would be far better suited in the demographically similar 9th district. This excludes, however, a few relatively towns in the easternmost part of the county such as Sedona and Clarkdale that are more aligned with the Flagstaff area. My hypothetical arrangement of the district would produce a competitive seat with the potential for a multiracial voting coalition that would represent the interests of both Native and Latino voters.

**Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District
District Rating: Safe Democratic**
Containing the dense urban core of Phoenix, this configuration of AZ-3 is one of the state’s two majority-Hispanic districts. This seat would take in urban Latinos in Phoenix and heavily-Hispanic Tolleson, as well as a small portion of Avondale. The seat is almost entirely contained within Phoenix’s municipal boundaries, making such a plan more amenable to local authorities. Moreover, this seat would keep together the center and downtown of the Phoenix metro are. It goes without saying that this seat would be safely Democratic, voting for President Biden by nearly 50 points in 2020.

**Arizona’s 4th Congressional District
District Rating: Safe Democratic**
Though this district is also a heavily Democratic seat in the Phoenix area, this one takes in distinctly different communities of interest. Rather than comprising Phoenix’s diverse urban population, this seat instead takes in its more educated and liberal suburbs to the east. The district is anchored by the city of Tempe (home to ASU) and takes in parts of southern Phoenix as well as parts of Chandler, Mesa, and Gilbert. Though the AIRC opted to include more conservative parts of Mesa to increase the seat’s competitiveness, I believe this was a poor decision on their part. Not only did the seat not become any more competitive (due to its bolt leftward in recent years), but Mesa is better suited in the 5th district for COI-related reasons.

**Arizona’s 5th Congressional District
District Rating: Safe Republican**
Arizona’s 5th district comprises the easternmost suburbs and exurbs of metropolitan Phoenix. It is anchored by the cities of Apache Junction, as well as most of Gilbert/Mesa and parts of Chandler. As most exurban areas are, this region is both exceedingly conservative and exceedingly White. Even so, it has not escaped the leftward creep of the Phoenix metro, shifting about 6 points to the left between 2016 and 2020. Despite these long-term trends, however, the lopsided nature of the district (voting for Trump by over 18 points in 2020) makes it unlikely to become competitive anytime soon.

**Arizona’s 6th Congressional District
District Rating: Lean Democratic**
Though by area this district is mostly comprised of the rural areas in Arizona’s southeast, an overwhelming share of the seat’s population lives in the affluent and educated Tucson suburbs. This includes wealthy municipalities such as Catalina Foothills, Casas Adobes, and Oro Valley, as well as some predominantly White neighborhoods of Tucson proper. This district was carried by President Biden by approximately 2 points in 2020, making it competitive on paper, but the seat’s leftward trend (as with most of the rest of the state) will make Republican victories in the district more and more difficult throughout the rest of the decade. For the moment, it is arguable that a generic Democrat would be the favorite in a normal race.

**Arizona’s 7th Congressional District
District Rating: Safe Democratic**
This district is the second of Arizona’s two majority-Hispanic districts. Moreover, it serves an important community of interest—predominantly Latino towns along the border with Mexico. The district stretches from the communities of Yuma and San Luis in the west of the state along the border to Nogales in the east. It also takes in much of Tucson’s Hispanic population as well as some mostly Latino areas southwest of Phoenix. Here, I will acknowledge a potential shortcoming of this district plan: the district could arguably be stretched further eastward to take in the border town of Douglas, as was drawn by the AIRC, but doing so would require stretching the district shape to create an odd-looking panhandle. Though a strong case can be made for including Douglas in the 7th, I ultimately opted to keep it in the competitive 6th district for reasons of compactness. In any case, the district is heavily Democratic and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.

**Arizona’s 8th Congressional District
District Rating: Likely Republican**
Arizona’s 8th is the last district contained within the Phoenix metro, taking in its northwestern suburbs. The seat would contain the entirety of Glendale as well as other large municipalities like Peoria and Sun City. Though the AIRC opted to include some of the northern exurbs of Phoenix to make this district more conservative, I believe that the seat’s current configuration still creates a solidly Republican-leaning seat that respects COIs and compactness. Though the seat voted for Trump by over 7 points in 2020, its leftward shift—along with the rest of the metro area—will make the turf significantly more favorable for Democrats over the course of the decade. It is not out of the question that in later election cycles, a Democrat could win this district. For the moment, however, it remains unflippable under ordinary circumstances.

**Arizona’s 9th Congressional District
District Rating: Safe Republican**
Finally, we arrive at Arizona’s 9th Congressional District, stringing together many rural communities in western Arizona. This district is by far the most Republican-leaning seat in the Grand Canyon State, voting for Donald Trump by 36 points in 2020. It combines many mid-size cities in rural Arizona like Kingman, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, Prescott, and parts of the Yuma area. It also stretches into Maricopa County to take in a few of Phoenix’s northern exurbs. Most importantly, it contains most of Yavapai County instead of the 2nd district, keeping these rural communities of interest in the same district as well as keeping AZ-2 competitive. This seat would be safely Republican.
