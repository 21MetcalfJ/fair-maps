# **Alabama**
![Detailed infographic of my proposed congressional map in the state of Alabama.](/Alabama/AlabamaProposedMap.png)

Like many of its neighbors in the Deep South, Alabama’s politics are characterized by its high degree of political polarization along racial lines. As such, much of my commentary will discuss Alabamian redistricting in this context. Likewise, most of the contention that arises from evaluating the fairness of any proposed congressional map in the state is deeply rooted within racial politics. More specifically, there has been a great deal of controversy regarding the number of majority-Black congressional districts that are mandated by the Voting Rights Act(Henceforth, VRA). This dispute recently culminated in the *Allen v. Milligan* SCOTUS ruling, in which the majority found that the state of Alabama violated §2 of the VRA by only creating one majority-Black congressional district. Any fair and legal map of Alabama, as of the time of writing this, should therefore contain two majority-Black districts.

The specifics of how these districts should be configured, however, create many controversies of its own. There are three general philosophies when it comes to drawing two Democratic congressional seats in Alabama, depending on how one interprets the *Allen v. Milligan* ruling as well as the VRA in general. The first of these philosophies prioritizes compactness above all else. One district would encompass the whole of Jefferson County and dip into neighboring Shelby County, creating a Democratic-leaning (though majority-White by VAP) district centered around Birmingham. The second district would contain the whole of the Black Belt, including Tuscaloosa and Montgomery; unlike its counterparts, however, it would not stretch down to Mobile. Furthermore, this district would be majority-Black, but only by total population.

This configuration does offer a few distinct advantages. Unlike the other proposals in this article, both the Black Belt and the Birmingham metro area are kept whole, preserving these demonstrably important communities of interest in their entirety (It would also allow the Mobile metro area to be kept together). Furthermore, this arrangement allows the map to be drawn in a notably compact manner, in stark contrast to the other maps presented. However, though this sleek arrangement may seem appealing to those prioritizing compact districts, it fails to adequately address concerns of racial fairness. Neither seat would be majority-Black by VAP, and anemic Black turnout (Such as during midterm elections) could easily flip both seats to the GOP. Therefore, this map is likely illegal under the Voting Rights Act.

A second potential configuration would mirror the first but with a few key differences. Instead of encompassing the whole of Jefferson County, one district would stretch from Birmingham to Tuscaloosa, creating a safely Democratic district. The second seat would encompass the entirety of the Black Belt as well as stretch down to Mobile, creating a safely Democratic district with a roughly 54% BVAP. This configuration has a much more compelling argument to be made for its legality. Though the Birmingham-based seat would only be majority-minority by VAP, the relatively higher concentration of White liberals in the district would mean that the district would remain solidly Democratic even accounting for variations in turnout. Conversely, while the other district would also be impacted by turnout fluctuation, its high BVAP would ensure it voted for Black voters’ candidate of choice.

Though there is a good argument to be made for this map’s legality, I opted to instead draw a map using the third and final hypothetical configuration to avoid any potential legal issues regarding the VRA. Presented in the above infographic, this district arrangement has two districts that are both majority-Black by VAP. By drawing the map in this fashion, VRA issues are avoided. My reasoning for drawing the districts in the manner presented is explained below.

### Alabama’s 1st Congressional District
**District Rating (Assuming tied national environment): Safe Republican**

The 1st district is undeniably the oddest-looking one on the map. It curves around suburban Mobile across the Alabama shoreline before making its way to Dothan in the eastern part of the state. Though the district may not look geographically contiguous, it does in fact narrowly snake across the Jubilee Parkway to cross the Mobile River delta. Though not an ideal representation of COIs, it is necessary to draw the 1st in this manner so that the roughly 90,000 Black voters living in Mobile are drawn into the VRA-mandated 2nd district(which will be discussed later). Voting for Donald Trump by over 50 points in the 2020 election, there is a near-zero possibility this seat would ever be competitive.

### Alabama’s 2nd Congressional District
**District Rating: Likely Democratic**

The notion of a second majority-Black congressional district in Alabama has been the subject of significant political and legal controversy. Though this short infobox cannot cover the litany of legal issues this district has been the center of, the dust is all but settled following the Allen v. Milligan ruling and subsequent redrawing of the district map. Though this district is certainly less compact than most, it needs to snake down to Mobile to have a sufficiently high Black population such that it satisfies the Gingles test. The seat stretches from Mobile across the Black Belt to Montgomery, ending in Phenix City at the eastern edge of the state. This district, while very Democratic in presidential years, is subject to major turnout fluctuation thanks to low-propensity rural Black voters. For instance, incumbent Governor Kay Ivey fell just 3,000 votes short of winning the district outright in her bid for re-election in 2022 despite the seat voting for Joe Biden by 16 points just two years prior. However, the fact that a Democratic candidate can still carry it even in low-turnout years (especially considering that Democrats would have had no reason to invest there) indicates that it functions as a Black-opportunity seat. Though it has been relatively stagnant in recent elections due to population decline in the Black Belt, it is unlikely to vote for a Republican anytime soon.

### Alabama’s 3rd Congressional District
**District Rating: Safe Republican**

Encompassing the Piedmont Upland region of Alabama, the 3rd district stretches across the eastern half of the state. The seat is anchored by the cities of Auburn and Talladega and is about one-quarter Black (It also encompasses some of the Whiter suburbs of Montgomery). This district, too, is a product of circumstance; if it were to go any further west, it would dip into the Birmingham exurbs. Any further north, and it would encroach on the Appalachian highlands, a region with which it does not have much in common. Voting for Donald Trump by over 30 points in 2020, there is no indication that this seat would ever become competitive.

### Alabama’s 4th Congressional District
**District Rating: Safe Republican**

Much of AL-4 is dominated by the rugged Cumberland Plateau. Because of this, the land in the region was never viable for large-scale slave plantations; as a result, the district’s Black population is by far the lowest in the state. Interestingly, the region gained local infamy during the American Civil War by vocally opposing Alabama’s secession from the union. Believing that the region’s population of mostly White poor farmers would not benefit from secession, many residents of the region [defected towards the union](https://encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/free-state-of-winston/). Considering this historical context, it may be surprising to learn that the district today has become by far the most conservative region of the state. This district voted for Donald Trump by an astounding 66 points in 2020, making it one of the most Republican districts in the entire country. This can almost entirely be attributed to its racial demographics, as voting in the Deep South is almost entirely polarized along racial lines. It is difficult to overstate just how ferociously conservative this area has become in recent years; the label ‘Safe Republican’ does not do it justice.

### Alabama’s 5th Congressional District
**District Rating: Safe Republican**

In this map, Alabama’s 5th district snakes along the Tennesee River valley from the city of Huntsville to the city of Florence in Lauderdale County. Unlike most of Northern Alabama, this region saw slavery [take hold](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2210232?read-now=1&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents) due to the fertile soil along the banks of the Tennesee River. Today, Huntsville is home to several major aerospace industries and is the fastest-growing metro in the state. This district keeps together Black voters in Huntsville and along the Tennessee River and creates a compact configuration centered around the Huntsville metro. Though this seat is not quite as conservative as its neighboring districts, its partisan lean of roughly R+30 firmly pushes it off the table as a competitive district.

### Alabama’s 6th Congressional District
**District Rating: Safe Republican**

This district, too, is oddly shaped as a result of majority-Black seats mandated by the VRA. Even so, it still captures a notable community of interest; the predominantly White suburbs and exurbs of Birmingham. Snaking around Birmingham’s Black population (which is located in the 7th district), the seat also encompasses Shelby and St. Clair counties, both of which contain demographically similar populations to the educated and affluent suburbanites of Jefferson County. By drawing a district in this arrangement, their interests can be adequately represented. Despite this seat seeing major realignment towards the Democratic party in recent years due to educational polarization and the leftward shift of the suburbs in general, it remains solidly conservative, and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future.

### Alabama’s 7th Congressional District
**District Rating: Safe Democrat**

For the last several decades, AL-7 has functioned as Alabama’s sole majority-Black congressional seat. The seat is anchored by the heavily African American city of Birmingham and extends southeast towards Tuscaloosa and the northern half of Alabama’s Black Belt. Though it boasts a relatively lower BVAP% than the neighboring 2nd district (50.1% compared to 51.6%), it is about 10 points bluer—largely because of the higher proportion of White liberals in Birmingham proper as well as suburbs such as Homewood. This district is safely Democrat.
